FABRICATION AND TESTING NOTES FROM LAB DAY

- stepper motor driver: have it screw right onto the nema17 back casing.  Include an encoder on it so it 
slips right onto the motor.

- change C4 on the schematic to 100pF
- change Aout1 Ain1 pin labels on the PCB
- 100 mil spacing between "F" and "in" pins for the breadboard



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Programming
- get a centralized document hub (wiki)
		- Get general code formatting for comments and for library (google: "java system.out" and provide code description that is the same)


- command list using the G-Code format: make sure I2C outputs correctly, then make sure arduino reads it correctly
		- get a level shifter for Pi to Arduino
		

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administration
- talk with Graham about funding (get time)
- get club space figured out (lab time=brent, space = canAssist)
- launch the club: club day?(talk with tyler and colby or Cory), start recruiting members
- order parts from China ( need members to commit to tasks)

funding list:
1) PCB Design: BOM for motor driver components and PCB ( $165 )
2) 3D printing: estimate cost= $100 (@$30 per roll)
3) Camera ($55/each)
4) Rasp Pi ($ 43/each plus tax and shipping = $60) < at least 2 >
5) expenses already paid (me = $140)
6) RFID: SOURCE THIS ********************************
7) batteries, miscellaneous (snips, solder, etc), 


Mentorship
- Albu: if we use a camera for robot vision, what should we start with?
	good first goal for getting a camera working? (for example: make a light blink for a microcontroller, hello world for programming)
