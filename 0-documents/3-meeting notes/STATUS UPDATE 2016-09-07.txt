Outreach
	- current: CSSE and ESS industry speakers.  One per semester, we bring in experienced professionals to talk about a industry of interest
	that is related to one of the clubs.
	- prevous: summer 2016 -> Canada and Space featuring Dr Don Kjossness.

	- initiative: establish a position in the ESS as clubs director.  Purpose is to source business students for clubs.  Similar method
	as LIM, for business students, where the clubs can post positions (i.e. finance director) and business students can apply.  The ESS 
	member gets information from clubs, and sets up an interview to see if the club wants to hire them.

Questions

1)	Tell me about your involvement with a club in the past (or someone you know).  Describe the professor's role.
	
2)	Formula One and Hybrid have massive sponsors, and I imagine there is a certain amount of responsibility that the club holds.
	With a similar end goal, how can you see the robotics club achieving sponsorship like Formula One and Hybrid?
	
3)	I have a personal initiative of gaining an undergraduate thesis through the robotics club.  
	- thoughs?
	- do you have grad students?
	
4)	If you were in my shoes, what would you ask?
	
5)	Do you have any questions for me?
