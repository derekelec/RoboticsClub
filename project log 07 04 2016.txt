motordriver PCB
- BOM: headers have both components to complete on, package type for chip
- eventually change RSENSE layout so that different resistors can be added. Have parallel bank so that they can be populated.
- fault is used by microcontroller: can have a light that blinks
- control is used to disable all motors (link a neutral)
- C1: put hot glue under it to stabilize it.


voltage regulator.
- connect all drilled holes to top and bottom plane: try putting J2 a bit forward so that the ground planes are connected for single sided board.
- make sure capacitor holes are correct size (0.9mm)


next revision
- standard size PCB outline so that boards can be stacked. i.e. the four stand-off holes are all in same location.
- also order right angle 2 pin headers for all boards just in-case.
- general board labels
