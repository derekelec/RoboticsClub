When creating or modifying your template for a specific document, try this.
Open the template in altium, and then also open the schematic file that you want to modify.
TEMPLATE
- make changes to the template, save it.
SCHEMATIC 
- file: design -> project templates -> choose a file
- chose the template that you just saved.
- Update Template pop up: choose "just this document" and "add new parameters that exist in the template only."

be sure to have the person making the schematic insert their name etc into the design
Design -> Document options : parameter tab
- change the author etc or modify as desired.
