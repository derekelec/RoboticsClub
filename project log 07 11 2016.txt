ALTIUM DESIGNER: customizing the BOM


C:\Program Files (x86)\Altium\AD13\Templates\A4.SchDot
alt -> tools -> parameter manager: click ok. Click on an unwanted parameter and delete it.  Add wanted
hotkey: t -> r

documentation : http://techdocs.altium.com/display/ADRR/Sch_Obj-Parameter((Parameter))_AD

create a BOM:
hotkey: r -> i
- have not figured out how to properly use the template.  It doesn't populate columns with information and
ends up being empty...
- now under "all columns" on the right, check off "comments" and move it to the top of the list so that 
the BOM is sorted by the comment inserted into each parts parameters.
- deselect desired: supplier order quantity
- add: items from BOM format that we use
- check off "add to project" and "open exported" then click "export"

Making the BOM have alternating color lines:
- select are you want to modify (all populated cells)
- styles -> conditional formatting -> new rule
click "use a formula to determine which cells to format"
=MOD(ROW(),2)=0 ; click on format: fill : select a color
-repeat this for =MOD(ROW(),2)=1 ; select a different color
- adjust the BOM accordingly and check for mistakes
